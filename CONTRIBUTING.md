# Contributing

If you want to contribute code you can get started by looking for issues marked as
[up for grabs](https://github.com/DotNetAnalyzers/StyleCopAnalyzers/labels/up%20for%20grabs).
We also have the [easy](https://github.com/DotNetAnalyzers/StyleCopAnalyzers/labels/easy) tag
for issues suitable if you are unfamiliar with roslyn.

You can also help by filing issues, participating in discussions and doing code review.

## Implementing a diagnostic

1. To start working on a diagnostic, add a comment to the issue indicating you are working on implementing it.

2. Add a new issue for a code fix for the diagnostic. For example, I added #171 when I worked on #6. Even if no code fix
   is possible, the issue is a place for discussions regarding possible corrections. Code fixes may, but do not have to
   be implemented alongside the diagnostic.

3. If a diagnostic or code fix is submitted without tests, it might be rejected. However, it may be accepted provided
   all of the following are true:

   1. The code is disabled by default, by passing `AnalyzerConstants.DisabledNoTests` for the `isEnabledByDefault`
      parameter when creating the `DiagnosticDescriptor`. It will be enabled by default only after tests are in place.
   2. A new issue was created for implementing tests for the item (e.g. #176).
   3. Evidence was given that the feature is currently operational, and the code appears to be a solid starting point
      for other contributors to continue the implementation effort.

## Building
