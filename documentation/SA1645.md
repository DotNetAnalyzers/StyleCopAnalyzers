## Cause

An included Xml documentation file does not exist.

## Rule description

C# syntax provides a mechanism for inserting documentation for classes and elements directly into the code, through the use of Xml documentation headers. For an introduction to these headers and a description of the header syntax, see the following article: [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc302121.aspx.](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc302121.aspx)

As an alternative to authoring documentation directly within the code file, it is possible to place documentation for multiple elements within a separate Xml file, and then reference a section of that file within an element's documentation header. This causes the compiler to import the documentation for that element from the included document. For example:

```csharp
/// <include file="IncludedDocumentation.xml" path="root/EnabledMethodDocs" />
public bool Enabled(bool true)
{
}
```

A violation of this rule occurs when the included file does not exist at the given location, or cannot be loaded.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, correct the path to the included documentation file to point to a valid file location.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
[SuppressMessage("StyleCop.CSharp.DocumentationRules", "SA1645:IncludedDocumentationFileDoesNotExist", Justification = "Reviewed.")]
```

```csharp
#pragma warning disable SA1645 // IncludedDocumentationFileDoesNotExist
#pragma warning restore SA1645 // IncludedDocumentationFileDoesNotExist
```
