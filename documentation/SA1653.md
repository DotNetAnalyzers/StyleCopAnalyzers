:memo: This rule is new for StyleCop Analyzers, and was not present in StyleCop Classic.

## Cause

The last statement in a C# initializer is missing a trailing comma.

## Rule description

A violation of this rule occurs when the last statement of a C# initializer is missing a trailing comma.

For example, the following code would generate one instance of this violation:

```csharp
var x = new Barnacle
{
    Age = 100,
    Height = 0.2M,
    Weight = 0.88M
};
```

The following code would not produce any violations:

```csharp
var x = new Barnacle
{
    Age = 100,
    Height = 0.2M,
    Weight = 0.88M,
};
```

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, add a trailing comma to the last statement in the initializer.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
[SuppressMessage("StyleCop.CSharp.MaintainabilityRules", "SA1653:UseTrailingCommasInMultiLineInitializers", Justification = "Reviewed.")]
```

```csharp
#pragma warning disable SA1653 // UseTrailingCommasInMultiLineInitializers
#pragma warning restore SA1653 // UseTrailingCommasInMultiLineInitializers
```
