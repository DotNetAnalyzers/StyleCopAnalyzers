## Cause

The clauses within a C# query expression are not all placed on the same line, and each clause is not placed on its own line.

## Rule description

A violation of this rule occurs when the query clauses are not either placed all on the same line, or each on its own line. For example:
```c#
    object x = from num in numbers
        select num;
```

The query clauses can correctly be written as:
```c#
    object x = from num in numbers select num;
```
or:
```c#
    object x =
        from num in numbers
        select num;
```
 
## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, ensure that all clauses are placed together on the same line, or each clause begins on its own line.

## How to suppress violations

```c#
#pragma warning disable SA1103 // Query clauses must be on separate lines or all on one line
    object x = from num in numbers
        select num;
#pragma warning restore SA1103 // Query clauses must be on separate lines or all on one line
```
