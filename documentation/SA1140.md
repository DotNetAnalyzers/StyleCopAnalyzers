:memo: This rule is new for StyleCop Analyzers, and was not present in StyleCop Classic.

## Cause

A maximum number of characters in one line can lead to a better readability on screen and printed code.

## Rule description

This rule is disabled by default. To enable add the setting for maximum line length to your stylecop.json.

```json
{
  "settings": {
    "readabilityRules": {
      "lineLength": 100
	}
  }
}
```

A value of 0 (default) for lineLength disables the rule.

## Known issues

Tabs in source file are not expanded to spaces for evaluation of the line length. Only use this rule if spaces are used for indention.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, wrap your code to meet the maximum line length configured in stylecop.json.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
[SuppressMessage("StyleCop.CSharp.ReadabilityRules", "SA1140:MaximumLineLength", Justification = "Reviewed.")]
```

```csharp
#pragma warning disable SA1140 // Maximum line length
#pragma warning restore SA1140 // Maximum line length
```
