## Cause

The name of a non-private readonly C# field must being with an upper-case letter.

## Rule description

A violation of this rule occurs when the name of a readonly field which is not private does not begin with an upper-case letter. Non-private readonly fields must always start with an upper-case letter.

If the field or variable name is intended to match the name of an item associated with Win32 or COM, and thus needs to begin with a lower-case letter, place the field or variable within a special *NativeMethods* class. A NativeMethods class is any class which contains a name ending in NativeMethods, and is intended as a placeholder for Win32 or COM wrappers. StyleCop will ignore this violation if the item is placed within a NativeMethods class.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, change the name of the readonly field so that it begins with an upper-case letter, make the field private, or place the item within a NativeMethods class if appropriate.
