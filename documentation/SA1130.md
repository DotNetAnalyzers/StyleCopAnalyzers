:memo: This rule is new for StyleCop Analyzers, and was not present in StyleCop Classic.

## Cause

An anonymous method was declared using the form `delegate (parameters) { }`, when a lambda expression would provide
equivalent behavior with the syntax `(parameters) => { }`.

## Rule description

A violation of this rule occurs whenever the code contains an anonymous method using the "old" style
`delegate (parameters) { }`.

For example, each of the following would produce a violation of this rule:

```csharp
Action a = delegate { x = 0; };
Action b = delegate() { y = 0; };
Func<int, int, int> c = delegate(int m, int n) { return m + n; };
```

The following code shows the equivalent variable declarations using the more familiar lambda syntax.

```csharp
Action a = () => { x = 0; };
Action b = () => { y = 0; };
Func<int, int, int> c = (m, n) => m + n;
```

:memo: It is not always possible to replace an anonymous method with an equivalent lambda expression. For example, the
following code would not produce any violations of this rule, because the anonymous method and lambda expression have
different semantics.

```csharp
var x = A(() => { });       // Expression
var y = A(delegate { });    // Action

private Expression<Action> A(Expression<Action> expression)
{
    return expression;
}

private Action A(Action action)
{
    return action;
}
```

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, replace the anonymous function with an equivalent lambda expression.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable SA1130 // Use lambda syntax
Action a = delegate { x = 0; };
#pragma warning restore SA1128 // Use lambda syntax
```
