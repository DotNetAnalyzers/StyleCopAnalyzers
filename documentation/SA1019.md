## Cause

The spacing around a member access symbol is incorrect, within a C# code file.

## Rule description

A violation of this rule occurs when the spacing around a member access symbol is incorrect. A member access symbol should not have whitespace on either side, unless it is the first character on the line. This includes member access that immediately follows the null-forgiving operator (`!`) introduced with nullable reference types in C# 8, such as `value!.Property` or `value!?.Method()`.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, ensure that the member access symbol is not surrounded by any whitespace.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
[SuppressMessage("StyleCop.CSharp.SpacingRules", "SA1019:MemberAccessSymbolsMustBeSpacedCorrectly", Justification = "Reviewed.")]
```

```csharp
#pragma warning disable SA1019 // MemberAccessSymbolsMustBeSpacedCorrectly
#pragma warning restore SA1019 // MemberAccessSymbolsMustBeSpacedCorrectly
```
