# Configuring StyleCop Analyzers

StyleCop Analyzers is configured using two separate mechanisms: code analysis rule set files, and **stylecop.json**.

1. Code analysis rule set files

   * Enable and disable individual rules
   * Configure the severity of violations reported by individual rules

2. **stylecop.json**

   * Specify project-specific text, such as the name of the company and the structure to use for copyright headers
   * Fine-tune the behavior of certain rules

Code analysis rule sets are the standard way to configure most diagnostic analyzers within Visual Studio 2015. Information about creating and customizing these files can be found in the [Using Rule Sets to Group Code Analysis Rules](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd264996.aspx) documentation on MSDN.

## Getting started with **stylecop.json**

The easiest way to add a **stylecop.json** configuration file to a new project is using a code fix provided by the project. To invoke the code fix, open any file where SA1633 is reported¹ and press Ctrl+. to bring up the Quick Fix menu. From the menu, select **Add StyleCop settings file to the project**.

> :warning: At this time, the code fix is not able to fully configure the newly-created **stylecop.json** file for use. This is tracked in bug report [dotnet/roslyn#4655](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/4655). In the mean time, users must manually perform the following additional steps after creating the **stylecop.json** file.
> 
> 1. Right click the project in **Solution Explorer** and select **Unload Project**. If you are asked to save changes, click **Yes**.
> 2. Right click the unloaded project in **Solution Explorer** and select **Edit *ProjectName*.csproj**.
> 3. Locate the following item in the project file.

>     ```csharp
>     <None Include="stylecop.json" />
>     ```

> 4. Change the definition to the following.

>     ```csharp
>     <AdditionalFiles Include="stylecop.json" />
>     ```

> 5. Save and close the project file.
> 6. Right click the unloaded project in **Solution Explorer** and select **Reload Project**.

## Documentation Rules

This section describes the features of documentation rules which can be configured in **stylecop.json**. Each of the described properties are configured in the `documentationRules` object, which is shown in the following sample file.

```json
{
  "settings": {
    "documentationRules": {
    }
  }
}
```

### Copyright Headers

The following properties are used to configure copyright headers in StyleCop Analyzers.

| Property | Default Value | Summary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `companyName` | `"PlaceholderCompany"` | Specifies the company name which should appear in copyright notices |
| `copyrightText` | `"Copyright (c) {companyName}. All rights reserved."` | Specifies the default copyright text which should appear in copyright headers |
| `xmlHeader` | **true** | Specifies whether file headers should use standard StyleCop XML format, where the copyright notice is wrapped in a `<copyright>` element |
| `variables` | n/a | Specifies replacement variables which can be referenced in the `copyrightText` value |

#### Configuring Copyright Text

In order to successfully use StyleCop-checked file headers, most projects will need to configure the `companyName` property.

> The `companyName` property is so frequently customized that it is included in the default **stylecop.json** file produced by the code fix.

The `copyrightText` property is a string which may contain placeholders. Each placeholder has the form `{variable}`, where `variable` is either `companyName` or the name of a property in the `variables` property. The following sample file shows a custom **stylecop.json** file which references both `companyName` and two custom variables within the `copyrightText`.

```json
{
  "settings": {
    "documentationRules": {
      "companyName": "FooCorp",
      "copyrightText": "Copyright (c) {companyName}. All rights reserved.\nLicensed under the {licenseName} license. See {licenseFile} file in the project root for full license information.",
      "variables": {
        "licenseName": "MIT",
        "licenseFile": "LICENSE",
      }
    }
  }
}
```

With the above configuration, a file **TypeName.cs** would be expected to have the following header.

```csharp
// <copyright file="TypeName.cs" company="FooCorp">
// Copyright (c) FooCorp. All rights reserved.
// Licensed under the MIT license. See LICENSE file in the project root for full license information.
// </copyright>
```

#### Configuring XML Headers

When the `xmlHeader` property is **true** (the default), StyleCop Analyzers expects file headers to conform to the following standard StyleCop format.

```csharp
// <copyright file="{fileName}" company="{companyName}">
// {copyrightText}
// </copyright>
```

When the `xmlHeader` property is explicitly set to **false**, StyleCop Analyzers expects file headers to conform to the following customizable format.

```csharp
// {copyrightText}
```
