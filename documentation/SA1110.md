## Cause

The opening parenthesis or bracket in a call to a C# method or indexer, or the declaration of a method or indexer, is
not placed on the same line as the method or indexer name.

## Rule description

A violation of this rule occurs when the opening bracket of a method or indexer call or declaration is not placed on the
same line as the method or indexer. The following examples show correct placement of the opening bracket:

```csharp
public string JoinName(string first, string last)
{
    return JoinStrings(
        first, last);
}

public int this[int x]
{
    get { return this.items[x]; }
}
```

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, ensure that the opening bracket is placed on the same line as the name of the method or
indexer.
