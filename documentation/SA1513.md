## Cause

A closing brace within a C# element, statement, or expression is not followed by a blank line.

## Rule description

To improve the readability of the code, StyleCop requires blank lines in certain situations, and prohibits blank lines
in other situations. This results in a consistent visual pattern across the code, which can improve recognition and
readability of unfamiliar code.

A violation of this rule occurs when a closing brace is not followed by a blank line. For example, the following code
would generate one instance of this violation, since there is one place where a closing brace is not followed by a blank
line.

```csharp
if (condition)
{
    DoSomething();
}
return value;
```

Braces that are part of an expression or pattern (for example, switch expressions or property patterns introduced in
C# 8.0) do not require a blank line when the brace is immediately followed by continuation tokens like `=>`, `,`, or
`;`. The same applies when the brace is directly followed by a logical operator (such as `&&` or `||`) or by a pattern
designation (e.g., `} patternVar`) that continues the same expression.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, ensure a blank line follows closing braces.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
[SuppressMessage("StyleCop.CSharp.LayoutRules", "SA1513:ClosingBraceMustBeFollowedByBlankLine", Justification = "Reviewed.")]
```

```csharp
#pragma warning disable SA1513 // ClosingBraceMustBeFollowedByBlankLine
#pragma warning restore SA1513 // ClosingBraceMustBeFollowedByBlankLine
```
