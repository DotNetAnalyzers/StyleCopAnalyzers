## Cause

A closing curly bracket within a C# element, statement, or expression is not followed by a blank line.

## Rule description

To improve the readability of the code, StyleCop requires blank lines in certain situations, and prohibits blank lines in other situations. This results in a consistent visual pattern across the code, which can improve recognition and readability of unfamiliar code.

A violation of this rule occurs when a closing curly bracket is not followed by a blank line. For example:

```csharp
public bool Enabled
{
    get 
    { 
        return this.enabled; 
    }}
```

The code above would generate one instance of this violation, since there is one place where a closing curly bracket is not followed by a blank line.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, ensure a blank line follows closing curly brackets.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
[SuppressMessage("StyleCop.CSharp.LayoutRules", "SA1513:ClosingCurlyBracketMustBeFollowedByBlankLine", Justification = "Reviewed.")]
```

```csharp
#pragma warning disable SA1513 // ClosingCurlyBracketMustBeFollowedByBlankLine
#pragma warning restore SA1513 // ClosingCurlyBracketMustBeFollowedByBlankLine
```
