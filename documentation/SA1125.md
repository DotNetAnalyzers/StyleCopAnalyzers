## Cause

The Nullable type has been defined not using the C# shorthand. For example, `Nullable<DateTime>` has been used instead of the preferred `DateTime?`

## Rule description

A violation of this rule occurs whenever the Nullable type has been defined without using the shorthand C# style.

This rule applies to the value-type nullable syntax only. In a `#nullable enable` context, long-form value type usages such as `Nullable<int>` or `System.Nullable<DateTime>` still report SA1125 and should be written as `int?` or `DateTime?`. Nullable reference type annotations like `string?` or `T?` are unaffected by this rule.

### Examples

```csharp
#nullable enable

// The following fields will report SA1125 and should use the shorthand form
private Nullable<int> count;
private System.Nullable<DateTime> timestamp;

// These nullable reference type annotations are valid and do not require changes for SA1125
private string? name;
private T? value;
```

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, use the shorthand version of the nullable type ie. int?, DateTime?, etc.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
[SuppressMessage("StyleCop.CSharp.ReadabilityRules", "SA1125:UseShorthandForNullableTypes", Justification = "Reviewed.")]
```

```csharp
#pragma warning disable SA1125 // UseShorthandForNullableTypes
#pragma warning restore SA1125 // UseShorthandForNullableTypes
```
