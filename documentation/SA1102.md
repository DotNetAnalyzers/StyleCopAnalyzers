## Cause

A C# query clause does not begin on the same line as the previous clause, or on the next line.

## Rule description

A violation of this rule occurs when a clause within a query expression does not begin on the same line as the previous clause, or on the line after the query clause. For example:
```c#
    object x = from num in numbers

        select num;
```

The query clause can correctly be written as:
```c#
    object x = from num in numbers select num;
```
or:
```c#
    object x =
        from num
        in numbers
        select num;
```
 
## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, ensure that each clause in the query expression begins on the same line as the previous clause, or on the following line.

## How to suppress violations

```c#
#pragma warning disable SA1102 // Query clause should follow previous clause
    object x = from num in numbers

        select num;
#pragma warning restore SA1102 // Query clause should follow previous clause
```
