## Cause

An identifier should be named only with Latin letters.

## Rule description

An identifier should be named only with Latin letters.

For example, the following code would produce a violation of this rule because identifier 'ЕxаmplеClаss' contains non-Latin letters **Е**x**а**mpl**е**Cl**а**ss:

```csharp
public class ЕxаmplеClаss
{
}
```

The following code would not produce any violations:

```csharp
public class ExampleClass
{
}
```

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, replace non-Latin letters with appropriate Latin letters.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
[SuppressMessage("StyleCop.CSharp.NamingRules", "SA1317:IdentifierShouldBeNamedOnlyWithLatinLetters", Justification = "Reviewed.")]
```

```csharp
#pragma warning disable SA1317 // Identifier should be named only with Latin letters
#pragma warning restore SA1317 // Identifier should be named only with Latin letters
```
