## Cause

## Rule description

A violation of this rule occurs when a using static directive is placed before a normal or after an alias using directive. Placing the using static directives together below normal and before alias using-directives can make the code cleaner and easier to read, and can help make it easier to identify the static members used throughout the code.

## How to fix violations

The fix an instance of this violation, place the `using static` directive after regular and before alias using directives.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable SA1216 // Using static directives must be placed at the correct location
using static System.Math;
#pragma warning restore SA1216 // Using static directives must be placed at the correct location
```
