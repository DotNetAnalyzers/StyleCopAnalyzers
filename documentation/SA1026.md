## Cause

An implicitly typed new array allocation within a C# code file is not spaced correctly.

## Rule description

A violation of this rule occurs whenever the code contains an implicitly typed new array allocation which is not spaced correctly. Within an implicitly typed new array allocation, there should not be any space or a blank line between the new keyword and the opening array bracket. For example:

```csharp
var a = new[] { 1, 10, 100, 1000 };
```

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, remove any whitespace between the new keyword and the opening array bracket.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable SA1026 // Code must not contain space after new keyword in implicitly typed array allocation
var ints = new [] { 1, 2, 3 };
#pragma warning restore SA1026 // Code must not contain space after new keyword in implicitly typed array allocation
```
