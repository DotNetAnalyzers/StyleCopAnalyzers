## Cause

The spacing around a C# keyword is incorrect.

## Rule description

A violation of this rule occurs when the spacing around a keyword is incorrect.

The following C# keywords must always be followed by a single space: `await`, `case`, `catch`, `fixed`, `for`,
`foreach`, `from`, `group`, `if`, `in`, `into`, `join`, `let`, `lock`, `orderby`, `return`, `select`, `stackalloc`,
`switch`, `using`, `where`, `while`, `yield`.

The following keywords must not be followed by any space: `checked`, `default`, `sizeof`, `typeof`, `unchecked`.

The `new` keyword should always be followed by a space, except in the following cases:

* The `new` keyword is used to create a new array. In this case there should be no space between the `new` keyword and
  the opening array bracket.
* The `new` keyword is part of a generic type constraint. In this case there should be no space between the `new`
  keyword and the opening parenthesis.

The `throw` keyword should always be followed by a space, unless it is part of a re-throw statement, in which case there
should be no space between the `throw` keyword and the semicolon.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, add or remove a space after the keyword, according to the description above.
