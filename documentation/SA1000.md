## Cause

The spacing around a C# keyword is incorrect.

## Rule description

A violation of this rule occurs when the spacing around a keyword is incorrect.

The following C# keywords must always be followed by a single space: *catch, fixed, for, foreach, from, group, if, in, into, join, let, lock, orderby, return, select, stackalloc, switch, throw, using, where, while, yield*.

The following keywords must not be followed by any space: *checked, default, sizeof, typeof, unchecked*.

The *new* keyword should always be followed by a space, unless it is used to create a new array, in which case there should be no space between the *new* keyword and the opening array bracket.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, add or remove a space after the keyword, according to the description above.

## How to suppress violations

#pragma warning disable SA1000 // KeywordsMustBeSpacedCorrectly
