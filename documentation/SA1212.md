## Cause

A get accessor appears after a set or init accessor within a property or indexer.

## Rule description

A violation of this rule occurs when a get accessor is placed after a set or init accessor within a property or indexer. To comply with this rule, the get accessor should appear first.

For example, the following code would raise an instance of this violation:

```csharp
public string Name
{ 
    set { this.name = value; }
    get { return this.name; }
}
```

The code below would not raise this violation:

```csharp
public string Name
{ 
    get { return this.name; }
    set { this.name = value; }
}
```

### C# 8 readonly accessors

Readonly members in structs do not change the ordering requirement. A `readonly` getter still needs to appear before any `set` or `init` accessor to satisfy this rule.

```csharp
public struct S
{
    public int Value
    {
        set => this.value = value;
        readonly get => this.value;
    }
}
```

The preceding property violates SA1212 because the readonly getter comes after the setter. Move the readonly getter before the setter to resolve the warning.

## How to fix violations

To fix an instance of this violation, place the get accessor before the set accessor.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
[SuppressMessage("StyleCop.CSharp.OrderingRules", "SA1212:PropertyAccessorsMustFollowOrder", Justification = "Reviewed.")]
```

```csharp
#pragma warning disable SA1212 // PropertyAccessorsMustFollowOrder
#pragma warning restore SA1212 // PropertyAccessorsMustFollowOrder
```
