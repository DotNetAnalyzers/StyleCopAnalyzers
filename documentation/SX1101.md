## Cause

A call to an instance member of the local class or a base class is prefixed with `this.`.

## Rule description

A violation of this rule occurs whenever the code contains a call to an instance member of the local class or a base class which is prefixed with `this.`. An exception is made when the name of a method parameter conflicts with identifier after the `this.` prefix, in that case no violation is reported.
This rule is disabled by default. When enabling this rule, the [SA1101](SA1101.md) rule should be disabled.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, remove the 'this.' prefix before the call to the class member.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable SX1101 // DoNotPrefixLocalMembersWithThis
#pragma warning restore SX1101 // DoNotPrefixLocalMembersWithThis
```
