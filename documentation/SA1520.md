## Cause

The opening and closing curly braces of a chained `if`/`else if`/`else` construct were included for some clauses, but
omitted for others.

## Rule description

A violation of this rule occurs when the opening and closing curly braces for a chained statement have been included
for some clauses but omitted for others. In C#, some types of statements may optionally include curly braces. For
example, an `if`-statement may be written with inconsistent curly braces:

```csharp
if (true)
    return this.value;
else
{
    return that.value.
}
```

Although this is legal in C#, StyleCop requires the curly braces to be present for all clauses of a chained `if`/`else
if`/`else` construct when braces are included for any clause, to increase the readability and maintainability of the
code.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, the violating statement will be converted to a block statement.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
if (true)
#pragma warning disable SA1520 // Use curly braces consistently
    return this.value;
#pragma warning restore SA1520 // Use curly braces consistently
else
{
    return that.value.
}
```
