## Cause

A comparison was made between a variable and a literal or constant value, and the variable appeared on the right-hand
side of the expression.

## Rule description

A violation of this rule occurs whenever the code contains a comparison between a literal or constant value and a
variable value, and the variable appeared on the right-hand side of the expression.

For example, the following code shows one commonly-seen case of this:

```csharp
public void Method(string value)
{
    if (null == value) // SA1131
    {
        throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(value));
    }
}
```

For the purposes of this rule, a *literal or constant value* is any of the following:

* A numeric literal, such as `1`, `0.0f`, or `5.0m`
* A string literal
* `null`
* `default(T)` (for any type `T`)
* Any expression which evaluates to a constant value at compile time
* A reference to a `static readonly` field, such as `IntPtr.Zero`

A *variable value* is any expression which is not considered a literal or constant value.

A *comparison* is a binary expression using one of the following operators.

* `==`
* `!=`
* `<`
* `>`
* `<=`
* `>=`

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, reverse the order of operands to the comparison.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
public void Method(string value)
{
#pragma warning disable SA1131 // Use readable conditions
    if (null == value)
#pragma warning restore SA1131 // Use readable conditions
    {
        throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(value));
    }
}
```
