## Cause

The name of a public or internal field in C# does not begin with an upper-case letter.

## Rule description

A violation of this rule occurs when the name of a public or internal field begins with a lower-case letter. Public or internal fields should begin with an upper-case letter.

If the field or variable name is intended to match the name of an item associated with Win32 or COM, and thus needs to start with a lower-case letter, place the field or variable within a special *NativeMethods* class. A NativeMethods class is any class which contains a name ending in NativeMethods, and is intended as a placeholder for Win32 or COM wrappers. StyleCop will ignore this violation if the item is placed within a NativeMethods class.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, change the name of the field so that it begins with an upper-case letter, or place the item within a NativeMethods class if appropriate.

## How to suppress violations

[SuppressMessage("StyleCop.CSharp.NamingRules", "SA1307:AccessibleFieldsMustBeginWithUpperCaseLetter", Justification = "Reviewed.")]
```

```csharp
#pragma warning disable SA1307 // AccessibleFieldsMustBeginWithUpperCaseLetter
#pragma warning restore SA1307 // AccessibleFieldsMustBeginWithUpperCaseLetter
