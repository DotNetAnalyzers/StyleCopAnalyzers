## Cause

A positive sign within a C# element is not spaced correctly.

## Rule description

A violation of this rule occurs when the spacing around a positive sign is not correct.

A positive sign should always be preceded by a single space, unless it comes after an opening square bracket, a parenthesis, or is the first character on the line.

A positive sign should never be followed by whitespace, and should never be the last character on a line.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, ensure that the spacing around the positive sign follows the rule described above.
