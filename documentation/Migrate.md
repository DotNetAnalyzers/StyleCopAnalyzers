## Migration from Settings.StyleCop to FxCop.ruleset (using F#)
##### Prerequisites
1. Old **Settings.StyleCop** file
2. New **FxCop.ruleset** file
  * generated by Visual Studio after installing [Nuget: StyleCop.Analyzers](https://www.nuget.org/packages/StyleCop.Analyzers) 
    and opening it via Visual Studio editor in Project → References → Analyzers section in Solution Explorer
3. [Index.hhk file](https://github.com/StyleCop/StyleCop/raw/master/Project/Docs/Rules/Index.hhk)
  * used by script as a reference to map rules' Id ⇔ Name
4. [Script file](http://fssnip.net/ss) downloaded in `script.fsx`
5. [F# installed](http://fsharp.org/)

##### Action
All settings files should lie besides `script.fsx`. 
Running `fsi script.fsx` will overwrite whatever rules you already have in FxCop.ruleset (if any) 
with the rules found in Settings.StyleCop and converted to new format
