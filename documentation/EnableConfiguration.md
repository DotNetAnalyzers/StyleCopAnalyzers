# Enabling **stylecop.json**

## StyleCop.Analyzers v1.2 and above

If you are using version 1.1.1 or newer, you no longer need to include stylecop.json using the methods below.  It is
automatically included if it is next to the project or in a directory above the project.  

## StyleCop.Analyzers v1.1 and below

For older versions of the StyleCop.Analyzers package (v1.1.0 and below), the code fix is not able to fully configure the
 newly-created **stylecop.json** file for use. This is tracked in bug report [dotnet/roslyn#4655](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/4655).
In the mean time, users must manually perform the following additional steps after creating the **stylecop.json** file.

In Visual Studio 2017:

1. Select the file in **Solution Explorer**.
2. In the **Properties** window, set the value for **Build Action** to:
    * For most projects: **AdditionalFiles**
    * For projects using the new project system, including .NET Core and .NET Standard projects: **C# analyzer
      additional file**.

In Visual Studio 2015 Update 3 and newer:

1. Select the file in **Solution Explorer**.
2. In the Properties window set the value for **Build Action** to **AdditionalFiles**.

In older versions of Visual Studio 2015:

1. Right click the project in **Solution Explorer** and select **Unload Project**. If you are asked to save changes,
   click **Yes**.
2. Right click the unloaded project in **Solution Explorer** and select **Edit *ProjectName*.csproj**.
3. Locate the following item in the project file.

    ```csharp
    <None Include="stylecop.json" />
    ```

4. Change the definition to the following.

    ```csharp
    <AdditionalFiles Include="stylecop.json" />
    ```

5. Save and close the project file.
6. Right click the unloaded project in **Solution Explorer** and select **Reload Project**.

## Next steps

Additional information about the content of **stylecop.json** is available in [Configuration.md](Configuration.md).
