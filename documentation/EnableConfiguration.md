# Enabling **stylecop.json**

At this time, the code fix is not able to fully configure the newly-created **stylecop.json** file for use. This is
tracked in bug report [dotnet/roslyn#4655](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/4655). In the mean time, users must
manually perform the following additional steps after creating the **stylecop.json** file.

1. Right click the project in **Solution Explorer** and select **Unload Project**. If you are asked to save changes,
   click **Yes**.
2. Right click the unloaded project in **Solution Explorer** and select **Edit *ProjectName*.csproj**.
3. Locate the following item in the project file.

    ```csharp
    <None Include="stylecop.json" />
    ```

4. Change the definition to the following.

    ```csharp
    <AdditionalFiles Include="stylecop.json" />
    ```

5. Save and close the project file.
6. Right click the unloaded project in **Solution Explorer** and select **Reload Project**.

## Next steps

Additional information about the content of **stylecop.json** is available in [Configuration.md](Configuration.md).
