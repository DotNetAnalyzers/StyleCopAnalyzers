## Alternative rule

This rule is a non-standard extension to the default StyleCop behavior, and represents an alternative style which is
adopted by some projects. Alternative rules are known to directly conflict with standard StyleCop rules.

## Cause

A field name does not begin with an underscore.

## Rule description

A violation of this rule occurs when a field name does not begin with an underscore.

### Detailed Behavior

This rule only checks the name of private instance fields. It ignores fields that are `static`, `const`, or have public,
internal, or protected accessibility. In C# 8 and later, `readonly` instance members on structs (e.g. `readonly` methods
or accessors) are not considered by this rule; only private fields—including private `readonly` fields—need the
underscore prefix. Static `readonly` fields are ignored by this rule (they are treated like constants).

## How to fix violations

The fix an instance of this violation, add an underscore (`_`) prefix to the name of the field.

Discard designations introduced by pattern matching (for example, `_` in C# 8 property or positional patterns) are not considered fields and are ignored by this rule.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable SX1309 // Field names should begin with underscore
int bar;
#pragma warning restore SX1309 // Field names should begin with underscore
```
