## Cause

The spacing around an operator symbol is incorrect, within a C# code file.

## Rule description

A violation of this rule occurs when the spacing around an operator symbol is incorrect.

The following types of operator symbols must be surrounded by a single space on either side: colons, arithmetic operators, assignment operators, conditional operators, logical operators, relational operators, shift operators, and lambda operators. For example:

```csharp
int x = 4 + y;
```

In contrast, unary operators must be preceded by a single space, but must never be followed by any space. For example:

```csharp
bool x = !value;
```

An exception occurs whenever the symbol is preceded or followed by a parenthesis or bracket, in which case there should be no space between the symbol and the bracket. For example:

```csharp
if (!value)
{
}
```

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, ensure that the spacing around the symbol follows the rule described above.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
[SuppressMessage("StyleCop.CSharp.SpacingRules", "SA1003:SymbolsMustBeSpacedCorrectly", Justification = "Reviewed.")]
```

```csharp
#pragma warning disable SA1003 // SymbolsMustBeSpacedCorrectly
#pragma warning restore SA1003 // SymbolsMustBeSpacedCorrectly
```
