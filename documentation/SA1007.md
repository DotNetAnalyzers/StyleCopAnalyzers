## Cause

The operator keyword within a C# operator overload method is not followed by any whitespace.

## Rule description

A violation of this rule occurs when the operator keyword within an operator overload method is not followed by any whitespace. The operator keyword should always be followed by a single space. For example:

```csharp
public MyClass operator +(MyClass a, MyClass b)
{
}
```

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, add a single space after the operator keyword.

## How to suppress violations

```

```csharp
#pragma warning disable SA1007 // OperatorKeywordMustBeFollowedBySpace
#pragma warning restore SA1007 // OperatorKeywordMustBeFollowedBySpace
