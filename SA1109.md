## Cause

A C# statement contains a region tag between the declaration of the statement and the opening curly bracket of the statement.

## Rule Description

A violation of this rule occurs when the code contains a region tag (`#region` or `#endregion)` in between the declaration and the opening curly bracket. For example:
```c#
    if (x != y)
    #region
    {

    }
    #endregion
```

This will result in the body of the statement being hidden when the region is collapsed.
 
This rule will not report violations when the [SA1123](http://www.stylecop.com/docs/SA1123.html) rule is active.

## How to Fix Violations

To fix a violation of this rule, remove the region or move it outside of the statement.

## How to Suppress Violations

```c#
#pragma warning disable SA1109 // Block statements must not contain embedded regions
    if (x != y)
    #region
    {

    }
    #endregion
#pragma warning restore SA1109 // Block statements must not contain embedded regions
```
