This repository contains an implementation of the StyleCop rules using the .NET Compiler Platform. Where possible, code fixes are also provided to simplify the process of correcting violations.

## Using StyleCop.Analyzers

The preferable way to use the analyzers is to add the nuget package [StyleCop.Analyzers](http://www.nuget.org/packages/StyleCop.Analyzers/)
to the project where you want to enforce StyleCop rules.

The severity of individual rules may be configured using [rule set files](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd264996.aspx) in Visual Studio 2015. **Settings.StyleCop** is [not currently supported](https://github.com/DotNetAnalyzers/StyleCopAnalyzers/issues/422).

## Installation

StyleCopAnalyzers can be installed using the NuGet Package Manager in Visual Studio 2015 RC.

## Team Considerations

If you use older versions of Visual Studio in addition to Visual Studio 2015, you may still install these analyzers. They will be automatically disabled when you open the project back up in Visual Studio 2013 or earlier.
